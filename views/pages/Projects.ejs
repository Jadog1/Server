                        This project searches state abbreviations and calculates which depot should ship what, according to fairness and efficiency. This arose from a work meeting and is used by depots locations. A previous algorithm relied on graph theory, but was swapped over to a cached distance calculation file that I created based off of latitude and longitude.
